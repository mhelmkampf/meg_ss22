## Overview

This repository contains data and code for the exercises of the summer 2022 course **Marine Ecological Genetics** at the University of Oldenburg.


## Required software

All exercises can be performed on the desktop PCs in the classroom. However, if you would like to use your own computer, the following software is required:

- R
- RStudio
- git

R is available at https://cran.r-project.org and should be installed first (on Windows, choose the base version).

For RStudio, select the free Desktop version on this website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

Finally, git comes already installed on computers running macOS. For Windows, install git from https://git-scm.com/download (using default settings), and follow the instructions at https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001927.htm.

Please install all software in advance of the course as time for troubleshooting will be limited during class. If you have older versions already installed on your system, updating them is highly recommended. Generally, this can be done in the same way as a fresh install, by following the links above.
